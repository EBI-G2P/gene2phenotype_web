    <h2>The Project</h2>
    <p>
      The G2P project shares detailed, evidence-based gene-disease models,
      curated from the literature by experts. These data can be used in the G2P
      extension of the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (Ensembl VEP) to
      efficiently filter genotype data from the exome or genome wide sequencing
      of people with genetic disorders to identify likely causative variants and
      accelerate diagnosis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project was established in 2014, focused on developmental disorders
      and has since been generalised to cover other disease areas. All data is
      made freely available. The initial paper is available
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10016-3" target="_blank">
        here </a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>We report:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Allelic requirement to enable more precise matching on genotype</li>
      <li>
        Variant molecular consequence to enable efficient variant filtering
      </li>
      <li>Mutation mechanism, with evidence</li>
      <li>
        Confidence, based on the strength of evidence available in the
        literature
      </li>
      <li>
        Additional information to aid clinical interpretation including when a
        genotype is only seen de novo and observations of reduced penetrance,
        mosaicism
      </li>
      <li>The publications used in assessment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The full curation process is described here and terminology used is
      described <a href="#">here</a>.
    </p>

      The Ensembl VEP diagnostic variant filtering pipeline matches patient
      genotypes to allelic requirements and genes reported in the literature to
      identify likely causative genes and variants. Full information is
      available <a href="#">here</a>.

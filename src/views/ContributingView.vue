    <h2 class="pb-3">G2P Curation Roles</h2>
    <p>
      G2P curation teams contain people with a mix of backgrounds and
      experience; clinical consultants/physicians, clinical scientists and
      biocurators. They collaborate to extend and refine locus-disease
      association data in a specific disorder area.
    </p>
    <h4 class="pb-2">Clinical lead</h4>
    <p>
      Each active G2P panel requires at least one Clinical Lead to oversee
      curation. They must have extensive clinical expertise in genomic medicine
      appropriate to the panel they are leading and experience in genetic
      research. They must be able to commit sufficient time to review new G2P
      records, often in team meetings, and to help resolve queries or review
      requests.
    </p>
    <p>Particular areas requiring expert consideration include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Relevance of a gene to a disorder</li>
      <li>The discriminating phenotypes for a disease-gene association</li>
      <li>Disease molecular mechanism</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Clinical leads may also contribute to record curation.</p>
    <h4 class="pb-2">Curators</h4>
    <p>
      Curators have training in a relevant molecular biology or clinical field.
      They create draft G2P entries for review by assessing publications,
      extracting and summarising information and proposing confidence levels
      based on the available evidence.
    </p>
    <h4 class="pb-2">Expert curators</h4>
    <p>
      Expert Curators have experience of clinical genomics (e.g. clinical
      consultants/physicians, clinical scientists) or scientific data curation
      (e.g. biocurators). They contribute to a specific panel and can create and
      publish draft entries. They can also update some fields and add new
      publications to records in the panels to which they contribute. They must
      be able to commit sufficient time to contribute to the creation and review
      of records in their disease area.
    </p>
    <h4 class="pb-2">Curation Administrators</h4>
    <p>
      Curation Administrators are Expert Curators who also perform restricted
      tasks like deleting and updating key attributes in G2P records in the
      panel(s) for which they are responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Institute member pages and publication records are used to confirm a
      potential contributor's suitability.
